## Reporting a Vulnerability

For most issues, GitHub's beta private vulnerability reporting tools are good enough to explain most issues. Then many other people can potentially help as well, including the entirety of the official development team plus related code owners. For extreme issues, emailing [khrysystem@proton.me](mailto:khrysystem@proton.me) works too, but please use good judgement on if it is really necessary to email.

In order to give proper information when reporting a vulnerability, ensure that general information, like OS, a minimal reproducible example (if applicable), and other associated information should be mentioned clearly whichever way is chosen, plus a brief description as to why it is a security hole (something beyond "It causes errors" please, because that is NOT a vulnerability, that is an issue, and should go into GitHub Issues).
